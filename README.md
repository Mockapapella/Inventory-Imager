# Inventory-Imager

A program that looks for an object in an image, crops it, whites out the
background, then makes the image square so that it looks like one of those images Amazon uses to
put their products on display. I made it very user friendly and fully automatic, so that all you have to
do is place the images you want to convert into an “Input” folder, run the program, and it puts the
final images into the “Output” folder.
